### Brainstorming Phase

#### Game Concept  
Today, we discussed the concept for **Pac-Pong**. The idea is to blend the mechanics of Pong and Pac-Man. The **main mechanic** we talked about is controlling Pong-like paddles to keep a character bouncing around the screen. We're thinking this will form the foundation of the game.  

We also threw around some ideas for **secondary mechanics**, like having players collect items scattered around the screen, while also avoiding obstacles that could either slow them down or end their run. We're leaning towards unlocking power-ups or special abilities by picking up certain items, but nothing’s been finalized.

### Key Features (To Be Discussed)  
We’re still in the early stages, so there are a lot of questions we haven’t answered yet. Some of the main things we need to talk about:
- How the paddle controls will work. Right now, we're debating between mouse, keyboard, or something more unique.
- What types of items players will collect, whether they’ll boost score, give power-ups, or something else.
- How obstacles will function and how the difficulty will scale as the game progresses.
- We haven’t decided on the scoring system yet. We’re wondering if we’ll go with classic high scores or add levels or achievements.
- The visual style is also up in the air. Should we go retro, modern, or maybe something completely different?

### Next Steps  
Here’s the list of what we need to figure out next:  
- [ ] Finalize the main mechanics (paddle controls and how the character will move).  
- [ ] Come up with a list of possible items and power-ups.  
- [ ] Decide on the visual style and overall theme of the game.  
- [ ] Nail down how scoring and rewards will work.

### Ideas and Inspirations  
We’re pulling a lot from the classic mechanics of Pong and Pac-Man. There’s also a lot of inspiration coming from retro arcade games. We might take a minimalist design approach, but we’ll need to discuss it further.

### Notes  
The focus right now is on establishing the core gameplay and the main goals of the game. We’re not diving into development yet – we need a solid plan first.
