**Progress Report: 3D Pong/Pinball Game - Prototype 2**

Our team has been steadily progressing with the development of our 3D Pong/Pinball-style game, which features two players controlling paddles and bouncing a ball between them.

### Current Progress:
- **Game Mechanics**: We’ve successfully programmed the paddle controls, allowing players to move and interact with the ball. However, we've encountered challenges with the ball's bouncing mechanics, specifically ensuring it behaves consistently when colliding with obstacles and paddles. Additionally, creating barriers to contain the ball within the play area has proven tricky and requires further refinement.
  
- **Prototype Development**: Gabe has been revising and building the prototype in Unity, focusing on resolving issues with the physics system to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

- **Assets & Ideas**: Ali has been researching assets for the game, brainstorming potential improvements, and documenting his ideas and progress using Markdown. His contributions have been vital for ensuring we have a clear vision for the game’s visual and mechanical aspects.

- **Documentation & Obstacles**: Logan has been working on editing the game’s documentation and writing scripts for the in-game obstacles. He’s been collaborating with Gabe to ensure the obstacles are integrated effectively into the game, while also organizing the design details.

### Challenges:
- **Ball Physics**: Getting the ball to behave naturally in collisions has been a significant hurdle. We’re exploring different approaches to address this, including tweaking physics properties and experimenting with various collision detection techniques.
  
- **GitHub Consistency**: While we've been making steady progress, we've struggled with consistently uploading our documentation to GitHub, which we plan to address moving forward.

### Next Steps:
- Continue refining the ball mechanics to improve collision consistency.
- Finalize the barriers to keep the ball contained.
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and uploaded to GitHub regularly.
- Collaborate on implementing any remaining obstacles and features.
